This repo has all the assignments for my Introduction to Computer Science II class. The first assignment was to simulate the three point contest in the NBA. The second assignment was to take in a file text and create playlist which the user can browse through. The third assignment was to simulate air traffic control systems. The fourth assignment had two parts. The first part was to make an adventure game where the goal is to collect the hidden gold in the cave and get back to the escape rope alive while avoiding the dangers in the cave. The second part was to calculate how many ways someone can get up a certain amount of stairs taking 1, 2, or 3 steps.
